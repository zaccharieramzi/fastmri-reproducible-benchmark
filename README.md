# fastMRI reproducible benchmark

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zaccharieramzi/fastmri-reproducible-benchmark/binder)

The idea of this repository is to have a way to rapidly benchmark new solutions against existing reconstruction algorithms on the fastMRI dataset single-coil track.
The reconstruction algorithms implemented or adapted to the fastMRI dataset include to this day:
- zero filled reconstruction
- [LORAKS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595341), using the [LORAKS Matlab toolbox](https://mr.usc.edu/download/LORAKS2/)
- Wavelet-based reconstruction (i.e. solving an L1-based analysis formulation optimisation problem with greedy FISTA), using [pysap-mri](https://github.com/CEA-COSMIC/pysap-mri)
- U-net
- [DeepCascade net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02422)
- [KIKI net](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624729)
- [Learned Primal Dual](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06474), adapted to MRI reconstruction

All the neural networks are implemented in TensorFlow with the Keras API.


## How to train the neural networks
The scripts to train the neural networks are located in `fastmri_recon/training_scripts/`.
You just need to install the package and its dependencies:
```
pip install . &&\
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
TensorFlow is not listed as a dependency to let you chose if you want gpu supported TensorFlow.


## How to write a new neural network for reconstruction
A good example of a simple neural network on which you can improve is the `zerofill_net` which is simply performing zero-filled reconstruction using `keras`.
The building blocks can then be found in `fastmri_recon/models/utils/`
